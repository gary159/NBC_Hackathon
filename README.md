# NBC_Hackathon

On June 23rd and 24th 2017, NBC Universal in partnership with NYC Media Lab organized a social hackathon.
This repo shows the work of two Columbia U Data Scientists that worked on the Data Science and Data Visualization track.

Data track, Social impact challenge question:
Per Scholas has a large alumni network. They want to effectively engage and track the progress of their alumni
to record and report out on program outcomes to their funders and partners. 
The challenge is to create a tool to connect their staff and alumni. In particular: job changes, promotions, new skills.

With @Amirosimani, we developed a facebook chatbot to solve the problem
